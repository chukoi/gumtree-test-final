# Gumtree

This is my implementation of the gumtree test.

It includes:

* Uses the React framework
* Responsive
* Error handling 
* Comments  
* Server-side rendering
* SASS
* Search engines friendly
* Cross-Browser support (IE does not work. Need to investigate)

  
## TODO

* UEX optimisation (Would like to add slide animations to the collapse, next and previous buttons)
* Optimizations (Minification, Obfuscation etc.)
* Use Redux for state methods for toggle, next and right links
* Fix hot reloading

## How to build

Run the following commands on the CLI from the project directory.

To build just run from the root directory:

    npm install

To start that application just use:

    npm run
    
To run the application, point your browser to:

    http://localhost:3030

[Application](http:/localhost:3030)
